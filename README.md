# Proxy for Welp
My System Design Capstone project for HRLA22. This is the proxy server which renders a collection of micro-services to mimic Yelp's restaurant listing page. The proxy hits a NGINX load balancer to redirect requests to one of several micro-service servers. This proxy support server side rendering.

My micro-service: https://github.com/vlobos/sidebar

The micro-service I worked with on this project phase was designed by another collegue during our Front End Capstone project phase where we each designed a functional front end component and accompanying database to render data.
