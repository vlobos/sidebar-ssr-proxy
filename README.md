# Proxy for Welp
My System Design Capstone project for HRLA22. This proxy server renders a collection of micro-services to mimic a Yelp's restaurant listing page. The proxy hits a NGINX load balancer to redirect requests to one of several micro-service servers. This proxy supports server side rendering.

My micro-service: https://github.com/vlobos/sidebar
